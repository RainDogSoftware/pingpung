          <h3>Does PingPung use my operating system's builtin ping utility?</h3>
          <p>No.  PingPung was written specifically to avoid reliance on any particular OS implementation of 'ping'.  Instead, the library in use was adapted from an existing Python 3 console application which can be found here <a href="http://www.falatic.com/index.php/39/pinging-with-python">http://www.falatic.com/index.php/39/pinging-with-python</a></p>
          <p>Because of this, PingPung requires root/admin privileges to run.  For details see below.</p>

          <h3>Why does PingPung require root privileges?</h3>
          <p>Creating a raw socket with which to craft a ping packet is a fairly low-level operation.  Any IP-network capable operating system has a builtin ping program, and part of the reason for that is because the OS maker can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid">setuid</a> that program so the user doesn't need to have those privileges to run it.</p>
          <p>Technical stuff aside, it's because PingPung is designed to use its <em>own</em> ping system, not your operating system's, so it doesn't have the built-in permissions that your OS's ping program does.</p>
          <p>Feel free to inspect the code if you have any concerns.</p>

          <h3>Why use Qt?</h3>
          <p>To be perfectly honest, it was simply because I had never used it, but had heard mostly good things about Qt's quality as a toolkit.  So far, I like most of it.</p>

          <h3>What is love?</h3>
          <p>Much like an M.L.T.  Or so I'm told.</p>
