# PingPung 
## A Python3 and PyQT4 Multiplatform Desktop Ping Application.

PingPung is intended to fill the niche of a truly multiplatform graphical ping application.  Unlike other desktop ping
applications, it does NOT use your operating system's builtin ping utility at all.  Instead, it uses a pure Python 3
library which creates its own socket.  Because of this, it will likely require root privileges on many platforms.
